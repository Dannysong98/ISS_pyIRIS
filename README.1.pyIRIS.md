# ISS_pyIRIS
###### Information Refining for *In situ* Sequencing
###### (Python3 version)

---

## Introduction

This software is used to transform the fluorescent signal of *In Situ* Sequencing (ISS) into base sequences (barcode 
sequences), as well as the quality of base and their coordinates. 

---

## Installation
### Development environments that passed our test

* macOS 10.14.x
* CentOS 6.x and 7.x
* Ubuntu 16.04.x and 18.04.x
* Python3 3.7.x

We didn't test our software on Microsoft Windows platform.

### Installing Python3 models

We suggest to invoke pip3 to install Python3 models, like:

	pip3 install numpy
	pip3 install scipy
	pip3 install opencv-python==3.4.x
	          or opencv-contrib-python==3.4.x
	
Our software don't restrict the version of numpy and scipy, but we restrict the version of opencv-python or 
opencv-contrib-python to version 3.4.x

## Compatible data type

We prepared 2 types of strategies to parse the different techniques of *in situ* sequencing, which are generated by 
methods published by Rongqin Ke and Chee-Huat Linus Eng.

Here, Ke's data (R Ke, Nat. Methods, 2013) is the major data type for our software. In this data, the barcode are 
composed of 5 types of pseudo-color, representing the A, T, C, G bases and background. 

In the type of Eng's data, each image is composed of 4 channels, of which, the first 3 channels means blobs with 
distinction by 3 pseudo-colors and the last one means background. Then, each continuous 4 images are made a Round, also 
named a Cycle. So, there are 12 pseudo-colors in a Round/Cycle. For example, the Eng's data 
(CH Eng, Nat. Methods, 2017) include 5 Rounds, 20 images, 80 channels.

### Directory structure form of data
#### Directory structure form of R Ke

Directory construction form of R Ke we required is:

	data directory
	|---cycle 1
	|   |---Y5.tif
	|   |---FAM.tif
	|   |---TXR.tif
	|   |---Y3.tif
	|   |---DAPI.tif
	|
	|---cycle 2
	|   |---Y5.tif
    |   |---FAM.tif
	|   |---TXR.tif
	|   |---Y3.tif
	|   |---DAPI.tif
	|
	|---cycle 3
	|   |---(...)
	|
	|---cycle 4
	|   |---(...)
	|
	(...)

#### Directory structure form of KH Chen

Directory structure form of KH Chen we recommended is:

	data directory
	|---cycle 16
	|   |---STORM.tif
	|
	|---cycle 15
	|   |---STORM.tif
	|
	|---cycle 14
	|   |---STORM.tif
	|
	|---cycle 13
	|   |---STORM.tif
	|
	(...)

## Usage

You should input the directories of cycle, like one of the following command if your data is consistent with **Ke's**:

	python3 pyIRIS.py --ke 1 2 3 4
	python3 pyIRIS.py --ke {1..4}

You should input the the image files in each cycle, like one of the following command if your data is consistent with 
**Chen's**:

	python3 pyIRIS.py --chen {16..1}
	
---

## Result
### Output of pyIRIS

There will be two output generated in the directory you run the command: the base calling result and the background 
image file. These two file would be used for following analysis of mating visualization script, 'DAIBC'.

    present directory
    |---basecalling_data.txt
    |---background.tif
    
### The format of 'basecalling_data.txt'

The format of 'basecalling_data.txt' contains five columns. Each column means 'ID', 'Barcode sequence', 'Quality of 
sequence', 'Coordinate of row', 'Coordinate of column', respectively.

    r00566c00969    AGGC    III4    00566    00969
    r00648c00397    NAAN    !!#!    00648    00397
    r00432c00243    NANN    !-!!    00432    00243
    r00484c00604    AAGC    ;E('    00484    00604
    r00290c01129    NNGG    !!!"    00290    01129
    r00724c00318    AAGC    =I3.    00724    00318
    r00243c01107    AGGC    IIE'    00243    01107
    r00777c00587    AAGC    IIB7    00777    00587
    r00198c01151    AGGC    =2++    00198    01151
    r00746c00342    AAGC    III>    00746    00342

Here, the values of 4th & 5th fields have been transformed to be consistent with the coordinates of pixels of 
'background.tif'.
